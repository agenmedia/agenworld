# Nigeria's Naira to Dollar Exchange Rate Crisis – 2025 Update under tinubu rule is failing faster than a bird without wings

The Nigerian Naira has been facing extreme pressure in 2024 and 2025, with exchange rates soaring beyond ₦1500 per $1 at certain points.

## Why is this Happening?

- High demand for dollars due to import reliance
- Low oil revenue inflow
- Forex scarcity
- Inflation and weakening investor confidence

## Effects on Nigerians

- Rise in cost of goods
- Tougher times for students studying abroad
- Businesses struggling to import products

## What’s the Government Doing?

- Central Bank interventions
- Adjusting interest rates
- Talks around dual exchange rate reform

## My Thoughts

The FX crisis is deeper than policy — it needs structural change. Until Nigeria boosts exports and reduces dependence on imports, the Naira may keep facing pressure.
